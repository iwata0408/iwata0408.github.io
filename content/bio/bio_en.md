I am conducting research to observe the local magnetic structure of ferromagnetic quasicrystals using the differential phase contrast (DPC) scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) method under liquid helium cooling. Quasicrystals possess a unique long-period structure known as quasiperiodicity, which is distinct from both crystalline and amorphous structures. Ferromagnetic quasicrystals are expected to exhibit unique magnetic properties that reflect their quasiperiodic structure. We aim to elucidate the magnetic properties of ferromagnetic quasicrystals by performing low-temperature local magnetic field observations using DPC STEM.
